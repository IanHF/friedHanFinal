*Proposed Changes/Additions:*

MDL 'modifications':
-Add distinct light source objects
-Implement mesh commands to be able to take .obj inputs
-Set/save knobs into lists so one is able to consistently change parameters of a render - a knob class would probably be how this is done

Additions:
-Assign things like the x/y/z values of a light source (for example) to dedicated knobs
-changing vary behavior to have different parametric equations as inputs and use these changes to move lights
-new 'primitive' shapes which are better for setting scenes:
  -low poly tree
  -low poly flower
  -a molecule?
  -maybe a utah teapot or some other well known model to test lighting
  -we'll see about other stuff

The ultimate goal is to be able to simulate a sun passing over a plot of land with things in it, in an arc like ours does during the day.
